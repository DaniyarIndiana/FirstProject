//Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending
//machine. An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar, in 5-cent
//increments (25, 30, 35, . . . , 90, 95, or 100), and the machine accepts only a single
//dollar bill to pay for the item.
//
//See the example output as shown below:
//Input:
//Enter price in cents: 95â†µ
//Output:
//Your change is 0 quarters, 0 dimes, and 1 nickels.
